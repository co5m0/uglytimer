# THE UGLY TIMER


Hi, I'm the **Ugly Timer**, I don't know what I am

But I am not a:

 1. good looking 
 2. full of functions 
 3. super optimized
 
 application. I was created just for fun.

TODO:

 - [x] ADD +/- LOGIC TO THE TIMER
 - [x] IMPLEMENT CUSTOM EVENT
 - [x] ADD REGRESS BAR
 - [ ] COMPONETIZE THE APP
 - [x] ADD SOME STYLE
 - [x] SEND PUSH NOTIFICATION WHEN TIME IS OUT
 - [ ] HOST ON GITHUB

 PLUS:  
 - [ ] ADD SETTINGS PAGE
 - [ ] PERSIST THE USER SETTINGS TO LOCAL STORAGE

GOALS:
 - [ ] CONFIGURE THE APP TO PERFORM AS A PWA
